## Selection Sort

Selection Sort is a simple comparison-based sorting algorithm. It divides the array into two parts: the sorted part and the unsorted part. It repeatedly selects the smallest element from the unsorted part and moves it to the sorted part.

### Time Complexity
- **Best case**: O(n ** 2)
- **Worst case**: O(n ** 3) due to the remove method
